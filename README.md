# Golf Scoring Probability Engine

A professional-grade backend (and simple web UI) for calculating golf scoring probabilities based on GHIN Handicap Index, course setup, and statistical models.

## Overview

This application helps golfers and tournament organizers answer questions like:

- "Given my handicap and this course, what's the probability I shoot X or better in one round?"
- "Over a 3-round tournament, what's the probability I shoot X or better at least once?"
- "What's my probability to break 100/90/85/80/75 on this course?"

For **team/member-guest best-ball** formats:
- "What's the probability our team net best-ball is X or better in a single round?"
- "What's the chance we have at least one great best-ball round over a 3-round event?"

## Features

- **Individual Player Probabilities**: Calculate single-round and multi-round probabilities based on handicap index and course setup
- **Team Best-Ball Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation for 2-player team best-ball formats
- **Milestone Probabilities**: Automatic calculation of common milestone scores (break 100, 90, 85, 80, 75)
- **Conservative Assumptions**: Uses realistic scoring variability to avoid overstating odds of exceptional rounds
- **Simple Web UI**: Built-in browser-based testing interface
- **REST API**: Clean, documented API endpoints for mobile app integration

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12+** with type hints throughout
- **FastAPI** for the REST API framework
- **Pydantic** for request/response validation
- **SciPy** for statistical calculations
- **NumPy** for Monte Carlo simulations
- **pytest** for testing

## Mathematical Approach

### Individual Player Model

1. **Course Handicap**: `CH = handicap_index × (slope_rating / 113) + (course_rating - par)`
2. **Expected Score**: `expected = par + course_handicap`
3. **Score Distribution**: Normal distribution with conservative σ based on handicap:
   - ≤5 handicap: σ = 2.5
   - 5-10 handicap: σ = 3.0
   - 10-18 handicap: σ = 3.5
   - 18-28 handicap: σ = 4.0
   - >28 handicap: σ = 4.5
4. **Single-Round Probability**: Normal CDF with continuity correction
5. **Multi-Round Probability**: Binomial model for independent rounds

### Team Best-Ball Model

Uses **Monte Carlo simulation** at the round level:
1. Simulate gross scores for each player (Normal distribution)
2. Convert to net scores using course handicap with allowance
3. Team net best-ball = min(player1_net, player2_net)
4. Track success rates across simulations

**Note**: This is a round-level approximation, not hole-by-hole modeling. It provides reasonable estimates for tournament preparation.

## Mobile App Integration

This backend is designed to power a mobile app. Key considerations:

- All endpoints return JSON with clear, typed responses
- Probability values are normalized (0-1) for easy percentage display
- Approximation notes are included for transparency
- CORS is configured for development

Example mobile app architecture:
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│  React Native   │────▶│  FastAPI Backend    │
│  or Flutter     │◀────│  (this project)     │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Future Enhancements

- GHIN API integration for actual score history
- Hole-level modeling for more accurate best-ball
- 9-hole match formats
- Stableford scoring
- Weather/condition adjustments
- Historical performance tracking
